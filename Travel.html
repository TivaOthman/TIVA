        <p><strong>1.Pack Smart</strong><br><br>Experienced cruisers have all sorts of cruise tips and tricks for packing, some more unexpected than others. For example, magnets will attach loose pieces of paper, like excursion tickets and party invitations, to your cabin wall. Colorful towel clips will stop your beach towel from flying off your lounger on a breezy day. Compression cubes are perfect for squeezing more into your luggage, while hanging washbags mean you can store toiletries vertically, rather than cluttering the bathroom.<br><br>Invest in a travel pill organizer for any meds to avoid packing endless bottles, and a jewelry roll to keep everything together. A USB octopus means you can charge multiple devices from one USB socket, although power extension strips are not allowed. A thermal water flask will keep your drinking water cool all day and is more environmentally sound, as you won’t be discarding half-full plastic bottles once they warm up.<br><br>A tote bag is perfect for the beach (if you’ve chosen The Retreat, you’ll find a very chic complimentary one waiting in your suite).</p>

        <p><strong>2.Arrive a Day Early</strong><br><br>If you’re traveling long distance, why not add on a night in a hotel before joining the ship? You’ll be able to enjoy a little local culture on your first night. You’ll arrive at the port fresh and ready for an adventure at sea.</p>

        <p><strong>3.Get to Know the Ship</strong><br><br>Part of the fun of the first day is exploring your new home, and a wise cruise tip from experienced sailors is to take a self-guided ship tour. This way, you’ll figure out where you want to sunbathe, eat, and relax, find classes you like the look of, and see the array of activities on offer in Camp at Sea.<br><br>You’ll be given a map of the ship, or can use your Celebrity app to explore. Start on the highest possible deck and work your way methodically down. You’ll be amazed at how much you learn—which restaurants beckon, the enticing treatments on offer in the aromatic haven of the spa, the best spot from which to enjoy the thrill of sailaway on your first evening.<br><br>If you’re traveling as a family with young children, knowing the shortest routes around the ship is always a good idea, as you’ll inevitably be dashing back to your stateroom every now and then for forgotten items.</p>
